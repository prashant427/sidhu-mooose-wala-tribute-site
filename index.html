            Moose Wala was shot dead by unidentified assailants on 29 May 2022; a Canada-based gangster, active in
            Punjab, claimed responsibility for the killing, which the police said was a culmination of inter-gang
            rivalry. On 23 June 2022, his first posthumous single, "SYL", was released.
            <br><br>
            Moose Wala's lyrics and themes were often seen as controversial in India, and he was accused of promoting
            gun culture and of challenging religious establishments[17]—as was the case related to Mai Bhago, a revered
            figure in Sikhism. He had faced legal challenges for his support of gun culture and his inflammatory lyrics.
